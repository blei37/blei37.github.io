The purpose of this game is to join creative minds together to create fun and interesting stories! At the start of the game, one player starts with a potato. They create a sentence and then they pass the potato onto the next person who adds onto the existing story and so on and and so forth. At the end, players will have created a game that they can share with others!",reflection:"The purpose of this project is to increase human interaction during a time when many may feel isolated or alone. I hope this project can increase the fluidity of communication between peers at school, collegues at work or just friends getting to know each other for the first time. Being confident in one's thoughts and not being afraid to share them is so important in every setting and I hope that this game helps take that vision one step closer to reality. In terms of platform, I decided to go with a web app because the main interaction with this game is through typing on the keyboard. This will leave out those who prefer games to be on their phones or tablets. One thing I could have improved on is have a language selector for the games, allowing those who know the same language to put in the same room. To increase accessibility, I hope to one day add a microphone dictation feature to the game, allowing those who have difficulty typing to write their part of the story through speaking words. All in all, I believe this a great game for any group of people who want to know each other better - be it in workplace, school or any other setting. Through this project, I hope I reflected my values for communication, human interactivity and equality. Each person has a voice to contribute to the overall story.",image:le},"Hardware Everwing":{description:"Hardware Everwing is a project I completed during my time at MIT's MOSTEC Summer Program under the EECS department. It features a third person shooter game built using Pygame and a Rasberry Pi. The controls consisted of phototransistors, accelerometers, buttons and LED lights. Players have to use the controls to eat as much food as possible while shooting down the enemies. This project highlights the beautiful harmony between software and hardware.",reflection:"The purpose of this project is to add a twist to conventional console style games through designing my own controller. It aims to be a fun game for others to play to reduce stress, compete with friends and most importantly, have fun! In terms of accessibility, this application doesn't require internet connection, allowing those with bad/no internet connection to access the game. Nevertheless, the game features a lot more controls that will exhibit a learnign curve for those who are not familiar with console games. Instead of the traditional keyboard style pc games or controller console games, this game has buttons attached to a Rasberry Pi breadboard containing an accelerometer to monitor movement controls. I believe that the hardware aspect of it adds a new dimension to this game, that other platforms don't offer. There are 3 buttons on the breadboard for changing position, compared to the tens of keys on a traditional keyboard. making it easier for those relatively new to computers to play a game they can enjoy. The game does feature a leaderboard displaying the top players. I do hope to give options in the future for players to opt in/out of the leaderboard rankings. Competition is fun but I much rather value equality and for all players to feel included in the space.

Inside the game, players can put together notes to create part of a or a full measure. The players add on and at the end, the players will have created a song together!",reflection:"This game was meant for those who are new to music to have a relatively low barrier of entry to creating music! It allows for friends to come together to create songs. I always strive to make a game that is accessible and inclusive. With the speaker and the joystick to toggle between notes, players can listen and learn which notes correspond to which sounds. I believe we did a good job in designing an easy to play to learn music! I really loved this project because it combined by two previous projects, Campfire and Hardware Everwing, combining the communication and creativity aspect of Campfire with the hardware component of Hardware Everwing. This game requries internet access between all users in order for synchronization putting those without good internet access at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, players can play the game by themselves to learn more about music. From the perspective of one that is new to music, I think this game serves as a great and fun learning platform. From the persepctive of one that is familiar with music theory, this game serves to elicit there musical creativity to craft an amazing song. From the perspective of any other stakeholder, this is a great medium to have fun and play a song-creation game with other peers, collegues or friends.

I began playing basketball in the middle school. What was originally just a small hobby grew into a strong passion. Each day after school I would come back from school and go straight to the basketball court. I eventually decided to go my local gyms. There, people played pickup games. Even though no one really explicity said it, I always noticed I was a bit different - I was the only asian boy on the court. Whenever we had to choose teams, I was always the last one chosen. The issue of inclusivity in sports wasn't just apprarent in my local gyms, this has been an issue for a very very long time. Ever since the dawn of sports coverage, news outlets and magazines always mention the heroics of white athletes, but rarely do they do the African Americans counterparts and almost certaintly never Asian Americans. In the 1970s, it wasn't your athleticsm, awards or skill that got you the cover story of the lastest Sports Illustrated Magazine, but rather the color of skin. With the invisibility of non-white athletes as came stereotypes that were attached to the color of one's skin. For much of history, African Americans have been viewed as ignorant, lazy and animal like. Asians were viewed as unathletic and weak. Even though this issue of systemic racism has been improving, there are still many gaps to be filled to this day. I hope that one day I can walk on a basketball court and not have to worry about the color of my skin.",image:xe},"Workplace Ethics":{description:"In the workplace today, employees and workers are primed to orders from their higher ups without giving much of their opinion. I believe that the workplace should move away this separatist structure because doing so can lead to detrimental effects. I want to bring up an example at Uber, which was highlighted by Julie Bort in her article: 'Inside Uber before Its Self-Driving Car Killed a Pedestrian: Sources Describe Infighting, 'Perverse' Incentives, and Questionable Decisions'. In trying to please their supervisors, the engineers on the self driving car team decided to push their work into production despite having doubts that there could be failure. This then led to an Uber self driving car to kill an innocent pedestrian. This could have been prevented if the engineers and the supervisors established good relations and there was fluid communication within the team. I believe that everyone has a voice and we should not be afraid to express our views in the workplace. In the workplace, there are often the notions of moral responsibility and professional responsibility as outlined by Wiley Blackwell in her article, 'Ethics, Technology, and Engineering'. Admist these responsibiities, the relationship structure falls somewhere between the two extremes of separatism and paternalism. I believe that the ideal appraoch is to adopt a specific framework but rather establish good communication channels between members of the team in all directions. Once we do that, we are more willing to voice our own opinions that stem from our own values and beliefs.",image:ke},"Moving Forward":{description:"There is not a one size fits all approach to every situation.

Nevertheless, I do know that I better equipped now to tackle those issues. Through experiential ethics, I have developed a toolset with which I can apply to every situation. I have learned how to view decisions from the perspective of different stakeholders as well as have a well defined set of principles and core values with which I follow. There will always be issues of privacy, the rights of individuals vs organizations, equality, and various morals and ethical issues that will undoubely arise in the future. There is no easy answer, but I believe tackling these issues headon and discussing it amongst ourselves is much better than burying these issues in the dust. In the work that I do, I try to analyze the values that I have promoted and others that I have not.
