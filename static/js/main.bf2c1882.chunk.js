The issue of inclusivity in sports wasn't just apprarent in my local gyms, this has been an issue for a very very long time. Ever since the dawn of sports coverage, news outlets and magazines always mention the heroics of white athletes, but rarely do they do the African Americans counterparts and almost certaintly never Asian Americans.

In trying to please their supervisors, the engineers on the self driving car team decided to push their work into production despite having doubts that there could be failure. This then led to an Uber self driving car to kill an innocent pedestrian.
